Redesigning America’s nutritional guidelines away from highly-processed, corporatized food, towards natural, clean food, while protecting the freedom to choose.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">For decades, small and mid-sized family farms have disappeared from the rural American landscape and economy, replaced by ever larger farms and food processors that consolidate food production into industrial factory systems. Cheap, plentiful, ultra-processed foods conceal the true human, animal, and environmental costs of this profit-driven transition.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The solution to these manmade problems requires a reversal of some of these commercial consolidations by relaxing onerous regulations that disproportionately burden smaller operators, and phasing out government subsidies that have favored large centralized industrial agricultural methods and operations at the expense of sustainable, widely dispersed local farms. A sensible list of policies that will improve food nutrition, productivity, and profitability for farmers and consumers alike will include:</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The Farm Bill</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Since its creation in the Great Depression, the US Farm Bill has swollen into an enormous juggernaut of funding and provisions. Originally crafted to connect farmers suffering from declining commodity prices with citizens starving during economic decline, the agricultural industry has changed dramatically over the past century. The Farm Bill has become an albatross to effective and responsive agricultural policy, dragging the nation in its wake. Current US farming policy is functioning under an extension of the 2018 Farm Bill; it does not appear that an updated Farm Bill will be legislated in 2024.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The chief reason for this damaging delay is that the Farm Bill includes too many provisions regarding too many players, and that there are really two teams – farmers and food assistance beneficiaries. For any revised Farm Bill to be enacted, it must craft consensus among the nation’s affected farmers (who have very different needs and business models, which also vary geographically and by crop), then dovetail that with provisions concerning the nation’s SNAP benefit recipients. These are two very different groups of stakeholders with very disparate policy goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The Farm Bill provides commodity loans and supports to farmers, and nutrition subsidies for low-income Americans. About 20% of funding under the Farm Bill goes to farmers: about 76% is allocated for nutrition: and 95% of that comprises SNAP benefits. Farms are facing unique inflationary pressures that impact food prices and thus the efficacy of SNAP Benefits: farms must be separately regulated to respond to such economic and market realities.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">The Farm Bill should be split into separate pieces of legislation for congressional consideration: the needs of farmers in one; those of food benefits in another. This will greatly improve political efficiency and effective implementation of policy for both groups – there will be no need for legislators to swap farming policies or funding as a political trade-off for food distribution or other provisions unrelated to the best needs of the nation’s agricultural production.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Changing Laws to Help Farms</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Regulations. Numerous federal and state regulations purporting to improve public safety have shuttered small farms and processors. It is not beneficial to Americans’ health and safety if there are only a handful of meat processors in the nation, or if local food production is slowly strangled as dependence on faraway, even foreign-grown (and less regulated) foods increases. Small businesses often cannot afford to comply with the high compliance costs that serve as a glass ceiling protecting the largest market players, whose ever-escalating economies of scale pose greater health risks and should be subjected to closer regulatory scrutiny.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Commodity Support Payments Through loans, price supports, and crop insurance, the federal government doles out billions of taxpayer dollars annually to the nation’s largest farming enterprises. These dollars are unavailable to small businesses, skewing food production toward larger, often more environmentally destructive industrial operations. Abruptly ceasing these payments would inflict unfair harm on many farmers and seed market anxiety and disruption. However, many of these subsidies are for environmentally deleterious, chemical-dependent monoculture crops, which have been unfairly favored by government subsidies for decades.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">As of February 2024, the 2018 Farm Bill cost American taxpayers $1.4 trillion. Farms received $22.6 billion in payments in 2019 alone. The highest amount of agricultural subsidies – well above $6 billion annually – go to corn, soybean, and sugar production. These three industries all employ industrial farming methods of methodical application of glyphosate, synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides to the nation’s farmlands. These processes not only taint the foods American children eat, but pollute drinking water, kill soil microbes, increase erosion, and deplete soil and food nutrients. They are also the three crops most damaging to human health after processing into syrups, hydrogenated fats, and food additives.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Paring down these payments will reduce federal spending; a mere portion of the money saved can be used to instead subsidize regenerative agriculture, pilot studies of nutrition and soils, opioid recovery models connected to agriculture, improved educational materials for schools, improved nutritional content in public school meals and public assistance food purchasing.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Sugar Subsidies</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">There is longstanding contention over the inequitable distribution of billions of US taxpayer dollars each year to sugar producers, while archaic domestic protections and import restrictions drive up US food prices: currently, Americans pay more than twice the world price for the sugar the federal government subsidizes through the Farm Bill. High sugar prices have influenced many food producers, including soft drink makers Pepsi and Coke, to replace sugar with more harmful but less expensive (and highly subsidized) high fructose corn syrup.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Taxing consumers for the “sin” of eating sugary foods adds hypocritical government insult to regulatorily-inflicted injury. Reducing sugar subsidies and relaxing border restrictions will lower the price of sugar while releasing funds to support farming and processing of other crops or food products or to fund increased incentives for healthier food options for SNAP benefit recipients.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Our nation’s sugarcane and sugar processing policies are grossly overdue for sensible review and revision. This will reduce costs for a widely used food input cost, relieving food inflation pressures for many industries, while equitably improving health outcomes. The important effort to reform US sugar policy has been underway for many years. A useful model to consider how some of these policies can be productively updated is contained in the (unenacted) Sugar Policy Modernization Act of 2017.</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">Areas of Future Investment</p><p style=\"text-align: start;\">By simply diverting some taxpayer dollars currently spent unwisely on practices that amplify short-term corporate profits at the expense of human and soil health, the agricultural system – and bureaucratically dizzying farming legislation – can be employed to heal what it has in the past inflicted. Money saved from subsidization of destructive agricultural practices can instead be invested for better food outcomes, including:</p>",
